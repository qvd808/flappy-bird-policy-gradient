# Using Reinforcement Learning to Solve Flappy Bird
This is my attempt at solving Flappy Bird using a simple algorithm called Q-learning. The code contains the implementation of the Flappy Bird game, with my own version aiming to replicate the gym.env.

Below is the demonstration of the agent playing the game

The implementation of the Flappy Bird environment was based on the [Flappy Bird environment project](https://github.com/Talendar/flappy-bird-gym) by [@Talendar](https://github.com/Talendar).

Special credit goes to [hsahib2912](https://github.com/hsahib2912). While researching the Q-learning algorithm for solving this problem, [his implementation of the Q-learning algorithm for Flappy Bird](https://github.com/hsahib2912/AI-Flappy-Birds) greatly contributed to my understanding of Q-learning. This valuable resource helped me successfully implement the algorithm in my project.
